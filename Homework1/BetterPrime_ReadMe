This is an improvement to Prime.java
    a. We could be checking just odd numbers by running our loop from 1 and incrementing
        by 2 every time. But the initial value of loop is decided by the user so we
        can't blindly increment by 2.
    b. As we are chopping off the right most digit until we arrive at a single digit,
        it makes sense to check the left most digit first. If it isn't a prime
        number, there is no need to check for properties
This will also have global variables that can be manipulated to
