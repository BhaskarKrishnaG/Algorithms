Hw 6.1 omits "Saturn". Why? Please submit your answer in a ".txt" file.
    We are storing the Object references in the Vector, so after adding aPlanet Object to
    the vector we are modifying the state of the object. Since the vector holds the reference
    of aPlanet and not the values the modifications will be reflected.
